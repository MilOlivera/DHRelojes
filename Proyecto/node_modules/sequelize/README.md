Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.

Sequelize follows [SEMVER](http://semver.org). Supports Node v6 and above to use ES6 features.
